### Purpose
This repo is an archive of all work I did in university. I tried
to remove all ties to the original course work and university itself. Executing any of these except the websites linked below likely won't work
as this is to showcase what I've completed in university and my general
experience gained. Almost all of the code present is my own; I omitted as much boiler plate, testing, etc. that was provided by the professor/TAs as possible. Most of the material either requires a custom implementation or is a few years old, so it's relevance to current projects in all classes is likely diminished.

### Websites
Click [here](https://spurslicer.github.io/University-Coursework/) to view the websites created in `Web Development` and `Front-End Web Development`. Note that software engineering requires external tools and a backend, so no websites are able to be viewed.
